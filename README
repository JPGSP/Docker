Basic docker configuration.

INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------

1. Rename the containers in the file docker-composer.yml
2. Go to the folder where you have the files from the terminal and build the containers
  ``` docker-compose up --build || docker-compose up --build --no-start ```
3. Once the process has finished it. Starting the containers.
  ``` docker-compose start```
4. Check the containers are running
  ``` docker-compose ps ```
5. Following all these steps, we can see there is one container which is not working, (nginx).
It is happen because, it needs a log file. (Info given though the command docker-compose up --build)
Create the file in the following path (this folder is at the same level as .docker)
```app/logs/nginx.access.log```
6. Running composer again
  ``` docker-compose start```
7. Verify everything is set up
  ``` docker-compose ps ```
8. When the containers have started, you can go to 
  ``` http://localhost:8000/ ```
